# The Kid's Guide to Outsmarting the Smart Devices

1. **Password Setting and Sharing**:
   - Always set strong passwords for all your accounts and apps. This means a combination of letters (both Uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
   - Notify parents whenever you set or change a password. They should have access to all your accounts.

2. **Social Media Restrictions**:
   - Do not download or use any social media applications. Please talk about a certain app with your parents if you're curious about it.

3. **Regular Checks**:
   - Parents can check any application or its history on your smartphone anytime. This is to ensure your safety and well-being, not to invade your privacy.

4. **Browsing Guidelines**:
   - Never share personal information (like your address, school name, or phone number) online without your parent's permission.
   - Avoid clicking suspicious links; never download apps or files from unknown sources.

5. **Communication**:
   - Don't chat with strangers online. If someone contacts you and you don't know them, tell your parents immediately.
   - Don’t share personal photos, especially those that can identify your location, school, or activities.

6. **App Downloads and Updates**:
   - Always discuss with your parents before downloading a new app.
   - Regularly update your apps and phone software to ensure they have the latest security patches.

7. **Location Settings**:
   - Turn off location settings on apps that don't require it. If you need help, discuss which apps should have location access with your parents.

8. **Cyberbullying**:
   - If someone is making you uncomfortable, being mean, or bullying you online, take screenshots and inform your parents immediately.

9. **Time Management**:
   - Smartphone should be physically separate from you and not used in the following situations:
     - During meals or family time
     - Before breakfast (on school days)
     - After dinner
     - During lessons at school
     - In your bedroom
     - When doing homework (unless used for music/soundscape that helps you concentrate on the task)

10. **Emergency Situations**:
    - Call your parents, a trusted adult, or emergency services immediately if you ever feel threatened or in danger.
    - Learn how to use your phone’s emergency features, such as SOS alerts.

11. **Public Wi-Fi Caution**:
    - Avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, as they might need to be more secure. If you must use one, avoid accessing personal accounts or performing sensitive transactions.

Remember, these rules aim not to restrict your freedom but to ensure your safety in the vast online world. Always communicate openly with parents about any concerns or questions you might have about your smartphone usage.
