# The Kid's Guide to Outsmarting the Smart Devices

1. **Password Setting and Sharing**:
   - Let's work together to create strong, memorable passwords for your accounts. Think of a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols that you can remember but others can't guess.
   - When you update your passwords, let's review them together. This way, we can help keep your accounts secure, and you can maintain your independence."

2. **Social Media Restrictions**:
   - Before you explore any new social media apps, let's talk about them. We want to understand what interests you and ensure they're safe and appropriate for you to use.

3. **Regular Checks**:
   - Occasionally, we'll look at your app usage together. This will be a chance for us to discuss your online experiences, not to invade your privacy, but to ensure you're safe and happy with how you're using your phone.

4. **Browsing Guidelines**:
   - It's important to keep your personal info private, like your home or school. We're here to discuss if you're unsure whether something is safe to share.
   - Be cautious about what you click or download. If a link or app seems suspicious or comes from a source you don't trust, it's best to steer clear and discuss it with us.

5. **Communication**:
   - Chatting with people you know in real life is always safest. If a stranger contacts you online, we're here to help you handle it safely.
   - Let's be mindful about the photos we share. Think about what they show about you and where you are. When in doubt, we can decide if it's safe to post.

6. **App Downloads and Updates**:
   - We're excited to see what apps interest you! Let's chat before you download something new so we can make sure it's a good fit for you.
   - Staying up to date with app and phone updates is like getting a health check-up – it keeps everything running smoothly and safely. Let's set a schedule to do it together.

7. **Location Settings**:
   - Let's go through your apps together and decide which ones really need to know where you are. Your safety is important, and managing location settings is a big part of that.

8. **Cyberbullying**:
   - Should you ever feel upset or troubled by someone online, come to us right away. Keeping a record, like a screenshot, can help us understand what's happening and how we can support you.

9. **Time Management**:
   - Your smartphone is a tool, not a companion. Let's agree on times when we focus on other aspects of life, like family meals or schoolwork, without the phone:
     - During meals or family time
     - Before breakfast (on school days)
     - After dinner
     - During lessons at school
     - In your bedroom
     - When doing homework (unless used for music/soundscape that helps you concentrate on the task)

10. **Emergency Situations**:
    - If you're ever in a situation that makes you feel unsafe, we want you to know it's okay to reach out for help, whether it's to us, another trusted adult, or emergency services.
    - Learn how to use your phone’s emergency features, such as SOS alerts.

11. **Public Wi-Fi Caution**:
    - Public Wi-Fi is like a busy public park — not all activities are safe there. If you need public Wi-Fi, let's discuss how to stay safe, like avoiding online shopping or banking, to keep your personal information secure.

Remember, we're setting these guidelines to help you navigate the online world with confidence and safety. We always want you to feel you can talk to us about anything you encounter online, no matter what it is. Your freedom and your safety are both important to us.
